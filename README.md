## Project Motivation:
In this project I will try to find out whether or not the salary is affected by gender using the data of the Salary Survey from AskAManager.org.
Hopefully the finding of this project will show no gap due to gender and if there is any, I will try to explore how does this affects the salary and build a model to predict the annual salary.
## File Description:
There is one notebook file that includes all the works related to the project motivation.

## Results:
The main findings of the code can be found at the paper available here
